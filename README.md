Facial Recognition on Android using dlib and opencv
============


This app demonstrate semi realtime face detection, tracking and recognition based on predefined face vectors.


Notes:
1. Set env variable OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK 

export OPENCV_ANDROID_SDK=/Users/hoopoe/Tools/OpenCV-android-sdk

2. From https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models

  copy 
  * shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat
  * dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat
  
  to /sdcard/Download 

3. dlib adapted to work with -DANDROID_STL=gnustl_shared


4. To enable Mobilenet/TF activity. You need to:

  Copy some model from 
  https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet_v1.md
  
  Change some values manually 

  private static final int MAX_RESULTS = 500;

  private static final int TF_OD_API_INPUT_SIZE = 416;
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
  private static final String TF_OD_API_MODEL_FILE ="file:///android_asset/spc_mobilenet_v3_1x_0.52_cleaned.pb"

5. OpenCV disabled for now
=======
  private static final String TF_OD_API_MODEL_FILE ="file:///android_asset/spc_mobilenet_v3_1x_0.52_cleaned.pb" 

5. To run "OCV-FTD":
   a) download "OpenCV 3.4.0dev Android SDK with contrib modules" from the following link:
      https://github.com/chaoyangnz/opencv3-android-sdk-with-contrib
   b) create "jniLibs" folder into following path: "FaceTracker/app/src/main"
   c) copy the pre-compiled libraries from OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/libs into the newly created jniLibs folder
   d) copy "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" into "sdcard/Download"
